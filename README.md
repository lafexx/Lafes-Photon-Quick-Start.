# Lafes-Photon-Quick-Start üåê
---
Lafe's Photon Quick Start is a tool that allows you to quickly implement basic optimised multiplayer functionality using Photon PUN.

## Compatibility
This package has been tested with Unity 2021.3.2f1 and works with versions 2021.3.2f1+, it may work with previous versions although it has not been tested therefore I can't guarantee it will work.

## Installation
- First, make sure you have Photon PUN 2 installed in your Unity project
- Download the Lafe's Photon Quick Start.unitypackage from this repository
- Once downloaded double-click on the file while Unity is open
- When prompted click import and you're done.

Note: Make sure to add the scenes at "Assets/Lafe's Photon Quick Start/Scenes/" to your scene build list for it to work.
