# Lafes-Photon-Quick-Start.
Lafe's Photon Quick Start is a way to quickly implement basic optimised multiplayer functionality using photon, all in one lightweight package. For more information see 'README.md'.

# Compatibility
This package has been tested with Unity 2021.3.2f1 and works with versions 2021.3.2f1+, it may work with previous versions although it has not been tested therefore I can't gurantee it will work.

# Install Guide
- First make sure you have Photon PUN 2 installed in your Unity project
- Download the Lafe's Photon Quick Start.unitypackage from this repository
- Once downloaded double click on the file while unity is open
- When prompted click import and you're done.

Note: Make sure to add the scenes at "Assets/Lafe's Photon Quick Start/Scenes/" to your scene build list for it to work.

# License
You can do whatever you want with it including modifying the code. But if you upload this repo to another and it's word for word then credit would be appreciated.
